In this tar file you will find 5 files:

 new_flux_ideal.dat
 new_flux_ideal.ps
 read_new_flux_ideal.f
 plot_new_flux_ideal.pro
 readme.txt

"new_flux_ideal.dat" contains the new surface and sensible heat fluxes 
to be used. The file is built as previous surface_*.dat files except for 
one value every 30 min instead of every 3h. It contains time fields 
and surface latent and sensible heat fluxes time series.



"read_new_flux_ideal.f"  a fortran file which read this file

"plot_new_flux_ideal.pro" a pv-wave proigramm to plot these fields

"new_flux_ideal.ps" the postcript file generated by "plot_new_flux_ideal.pro" 


Nota: The time series has been constructed from direct observed total 
sensible and latent heat fluxes splitted into sensible and latent 
using the Bowen Ratio from the ARM product.
